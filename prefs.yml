include_minimized:
  value: False
  description: When freezing or restoring layout, bring up and include minimized windows.

snap_to_grid:
  value: True
  description: |
    When freezing layout, round each window coordinates to the nearest 0 or 5.
    This makes it easier to line up windows evenly.

fit_into_screen:
  value: True
  description: When freezing or restoring layout, adjust windows coordinates to fit into screen boundaries.

match_cutoff:
  value: 0.6
  description: |
    When restoring layout, if saved configs are found for a process but titles do not match the current window title exactly, then closest matching title will be selected.
    This parameter controls similarity treshold in a range of 0.1-1.0 (the higher the value, the more precisely titles need to match to be included into comparison).
    Titles with similarity value less then this treshold will not be considered.

enable_hotkeys:
  value: True
  description: Enable global hotkeys listener (uncheck in case of collisions with other apps; alternatively, change keys combination below for conflicting operations).

hotkeys:
  value:
    freeze_new      : <ctrl>+<alt>+f
    freeze_all      : <ctrl>+<alt>+<shift>+f
    restore         : <ctrl>+<alt>+r
  description: |
    Supported key combinations:
     - Ctrl + Alt + letter/digit
     - Ctrl + Alt + Shift + letter/digit
    Supported format: <ctrl>+<alt>[+<shift>]+x

guess_params_priority_order:
  value:
    - display_orientation
    - display_index
    - display_primary
  description: |
    When restoring layout, if saved configs are found for a process, but not in current display layout,
    LayoutFreezer will attempt to guess the most appropriate window position based on number of properties in saved configs.
    This parameter determines priority of each property (the first in the list is the highest priority)
