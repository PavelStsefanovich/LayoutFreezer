# their display config saved for current screen layout (process name + title)
# otherwise: remove saved configs for affected apps before freezing

# when restoring layout, if saved configs are found for a process, 
# but not exactly same title found in any of those configs,
# then attempt is made to find the closest matching title using difflib.get_close_matches().
# use this parameter to control the lowest allowed measure of the similarity.
# (the higher the value, the more similar titles will be included into comparison)
# (allowed range: float 0-1)
