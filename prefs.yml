match_cutoff:
  value: 0.6
  description: |
    When restoring layout, if saved configs are found for a process but titles do not match the current window title exactly, then closest matching title will be selected.
    This parameter controls similarity treshold in a range of 0.1-1.0 (the higher the value, the more precisely titles need to match to be included into comparison).
    Titles with similarity value less then this treshold will not be considered.
